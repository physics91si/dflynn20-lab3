Part1:
    - Very clean. Works as expected. Very glad you found "re" library to help you and do the work for you
    
Part2:
    - Again, clean code, and very concise. I can't see any redundancy. Great job!
    
Part3:
    - Print statements are as clear as they could get. You could've printed the statement and values in the same line if you used print(string,value), but that's just a preference thing.
